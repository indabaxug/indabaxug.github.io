He is also a visiting lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he leads the Robotics, Autonomous Intelligence and Learning laboratory.
			  <br>
			  <br>
Rosman holds a PhD degree in informatics from the University of Edinburgh.Rosmanâ€™s research interests focus primarily on learning and decision-making in autonomous systems, in particular studying how learning can be accelerated through abstracting and generalising knowledge gained from solving previous problems. He also works in the area of skill and behaviour learning for robots.
<br>
<br>
A large part of his research focuses on transferring knowledge and constructing skill hierarchies in reinforcement learning, as well as extending these ideas to scenarios with rich sensory information and partial observability. He is also the chair of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, South African joint chapter of Control Systems and Robotics and Automation.

He studies statistical techniques for discovery, dimensionality reduction, and visual interaction in complex data, with a focus on climate change and the microbiome. He was previously a postdoc in humanitarian AI at Mila in Montreal, in Yoshua Bengio's group. I completed my PhD in Statistics at Stanford University, advised by Susan Holmes. My thesis was on Discovery and Visualization of Latent Structure with Applications to the Microbiome.

Dr. Kris seeks out simple strategies for making progress on real-world problems. He thinks that sharing reproducible workflows and accessible distillations is as important as making discoveries and proposing algorithms. My ideal researcher is an insightful scientist, as well as a skilled technician.

              <p>In Uganda there are quite few researchers working on different aspects of artificial intelligence from machine learning, algorithms, logic-based and scientific computing perspectives. INDABAXUG is intended to bring together researchers, industry and academia interested in these areas of AI.</p><br>
              <P>The central theme of INDABAXUG is combinations of, and synergies between, machine learning and symbolic AI. The workshops will focus on recent trends, aiming at finding common ground and interests that point forward to the coming years.</P> <br>

              <P>The outcome of the workshops will ideally be to identify where the field as a whole is heading and to pinpoint how we can use the competences in Uganda to exploit the potential synergies and stay at the front in research, teaching and industrial collaboration.</P>

Deep Learning IndabaX-Ug is a locally-organized 
conference that seeks to spread knowledge and 
capacity in Machine Learning across the African 
continent. Deep Learning events bring together 
students, researchers and industry experts who 
are passionate about the field of Artificial 
intelligence and its growth. 
<br>
Since 2018, a total of 39 IndabaX events have been 
organized in different countries across Africa, 
growing the community by over 2,000 attendees. 
 
<br>
The conference will be hosted by Uganda Technology and Management University (UTAMU)
and over 300 participants are expected 
to be part of this event that will take place 
in Kampala, Uganda at Silver Springs Hotel, Bugolobi. The conference will have three major sections: Tutorials (26th-28th, July 2021), Hackathon (29th, July 2021) and Conference (Invited Talks, Spotlights Talks, Poster Session, Exhibition) Day (30th, July 2021). 
<br>
The conference will provide an opportunity for 
researchers and practitioners to share their 
understanding and use of Artificial Intelligence
 (AI), in solving societal problems, as well as 
 to look at possibilities for setting-up new 
 trends in this area under the theme, 
 <b>The social Impact of AI</b>" 
<br>
Furthermore, there will be an online hackathon 
provided by Zindi (a data science competition platform with the mission of building the data science ecosystem in Africa) for country engagement.
